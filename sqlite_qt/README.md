# sql_with_qt

This repository is a small example of how to set up sqlite database with Qt and perform some basic queries.

# Instructions
1. Install [SQLITE](https://www.sqlite.org)
2. Download this Github repository
3. Run in QT Creator and watch it connect to the database.

Visit the main article [here](https://katecpp.wordpress.com/2015/08/28/sqlite-with-qt/) to understand more.

**IMPORTANT** If you don't see your database file show up in your file directory, you need to go to Projects -> Build & Run -> Run -> Working Directory. This is where your database file will be generated.
