    <h1>How to use QTFFmpegWrapper</h1>
    <h2>General instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a QT project in the usual way</li>
      <li>Copy the directory QTFFmpegWrapper into your project</li>
      <li>Edit your project .pro file: </li>
      <ol>
        <li>copy at the end the content of config.pro,</li>
        <li>and modify the path for the QTFFmpegWrapper directory, the
          FFmpeg import libraries, and the FFmpeg includes</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Make sure the FFmpeg dynamic link libraries are available in
        your
        path - otherwise the program will crash upon start</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes for Linux<br>
    </h2>
    The FFmpeg import libraries and FFmpeg includes are in their usual
    locations - these path may be left empty in the .pro file.<br>
    Also, the FFmpeg dynamic link libaries are likely already in the
    path.<br>
    <h2>Notes for Windows<br>
    </h2>
    The current version uses the zeranoe ffmpeg builds under windows: <a
      href="http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/">http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/</a><br>
    For convenience we provide for download the ffmpeg libs matching the
    wrapper code.<br>
    <h3>Older releases</h3>
    Initial releases used a custom-compiled ffmpeg, following the
    instructions given at <a
      href="http://ffmpeg.arrozcru.org/wiki/index.php">http://ffmpeg.arrozcru.org/wiki/index.php</a><br>
    <br>
    You will need to install an msys+mingw build system. Follow the
    instructions carefully, in particular "Building FFmpeg SVN dlls". As
    of
    09.01.2010, compilation has been successful using gcc 4.2.1-sjlj and
    the FFmpeg SVN revision 20736 (2009-12-05). Compilation with gcc
    3.4.5
    did not succeed.<br>
    <br>
    Once FFmpeg is compiled and installed:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The FFmpeg dll are in C:\msys\local\bin (libavcodec,
        libavutil,
        libavdevice, libavformat, libswscale). These are the dynamic
        libraries.
        They must be available in your path. Alternatively copy them in
        your
        application Debug or Release directory where your executable is
        compiled.</li>
      <li>The FFmpeg .dll.a files are in C:\msys\local\lib. These are
        the
        import libraries. Set the path in the .pro file to where they
        are
        located.</li>
      <li>The FFmpeg includs are in C:\msys\local\include. However, some
        include files are not automatically installed when doing 'make
        install'. For convenience, the required FFmpeg include files are
        also
        provided in the QTFFmpeg directory</li>
    </ul>
    For convenience, pre-compiled FFmpeg libraries are provided in
    ffmpeg_lib_win32. Copy these files or set path to these according to
    the instructions above. The required FFmpeg includes are in
    QTFFmpegWrapper.<br>

    demonstrating
    how to use QTFFmpeg.<br>
