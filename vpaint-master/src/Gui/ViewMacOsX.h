// An ad-hoc class to hold a View + ViewSettings, to workaround the limitation:
//   On Mac OS X, when Qt is built with Cocoa support, a QGLWidget can't
//   have any sibling widgets placed ontop of itself. This is due to limitations
//   in the Cocoa API and is not supported by Apple.
// (cf Qt doc, QGLWidget class)
//
// Therefore, on Mac, the ViewSettings do not lie on top of the view, but as a "toolbar"
