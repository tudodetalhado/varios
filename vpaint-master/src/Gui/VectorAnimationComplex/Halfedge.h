/* -------------------- Halfedge.h --------------------
 *
 * In a nutshell, this file defines the following three classes:
 *
 *    struct Halfedge          { EdgeCell *      edge;  bool side; };
 *    struct KeyHalfedge       { KeyEdge *       edge;  bool side; };
 *    struct InbetweenHalfedge { InbetweenEdge * edge;  bool side; };
 *
 * Note that KeyHalfedge and InbetweenHalfedge do NOT inherit from Halfedge.
 * In practice, to factorize code, we define a templated class:
 *
 *    template <class TEdge> struct HalfedgeBase { TEdge * edge;  bool side; [+ methods common to all 3 classes] };
 *
 * Which is used to define our three classes:
 *
 * typedef HalfedgeBase<EdgeCell> Halfedge;
 * class KeyHalfedge:       public HalfedgeBase<KeyEdge>       { [methods specific to KeyHalfedge] };
 * class InbetweenHalfedge: public HalfedgeBase<InbetweenEdge> { [methods specific to InbetweenHalfedge] };
 *
