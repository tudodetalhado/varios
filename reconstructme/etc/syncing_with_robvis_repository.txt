To import the current state of the open-source project into robvis repository (or vice versa) 
we use vendor branches.

Assume that the latest open-source release 1.0.40 and our current internal trunk reflects 1.0.35. 
Then proceed as follows to update the robvis internal to 1.0.40

 - export 1.0.40 from googlecode to local directory <EXPORT>
 - use robvis/svn_helpers/svn_load_dirs.pl to match the changes (requires perl interpreter)
   exectute: perl svn_load_dirs.pl <BASE_DIRECTORY> <CURRENT> <EXPORT> 
   where <BASE_DIRECTORY> is the path to robvis repository containing the subdirectory <CURRENT> 
   that holds version 1.0.35 to be upgraded.
 
 - update version number in hudson_build script
 - update version number in cmakelists.txt
 - update versionnumber in qsettings, to make shure to use the moset current onse

 - example: svn_load_dirs.pl https://pinguin.profactor.at/mas/ ras_projects/reconstructme-qt/trunk D:\reconstructme-qt-export
   this updated the trunk to the current development state
 - Vendor-Branch check out
 - Merge Vendor-Branch with Trunk in Branch
 - Vendor-Branch commit
 - Vendor-Branch build at hudson
