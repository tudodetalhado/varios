//! The AbstractGrabber class is the base of all grabbers.
/*!
  The class defines the functions for the functionality shared by all grabbers. By inheriting this class, you can create custom grabbers that grab image or audio data.

  Grabbers have three states: Active, Stopped, or Paused--as defined by the AbstractGrabber::State enum.
  The current state can be changed by calling start(), stop(), suspend(), or resume().
  AbstractGrabber will emit stateChanged() whenever its state changes.
