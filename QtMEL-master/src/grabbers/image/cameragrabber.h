//! The CameraGrabber class allows the application to capture frames from a camera device.
/*!
  Using this class you can capture frames with variable frame rate from a camera device. In order to get available devices
  call the availableDeviceNames() static function. To let CameraGrabber know which camera it must grab pass the device index to the setDeviceIndex() function.
  The CameraGrabber class has the setInitializationTime() function to set time the app will wait before grabbing start. It is need to be used because you
  will get black(or other colors) frames while a device is turning on. To get maximum frame size supported by a device use the the maximumFrameSize() static function.
  If you want to get a frame with the size that smaller or larger than maximumFrameSize() then you can set the needed size calling the setSize() function.

  The signal frameAvailable() is emmited whenever a new frame is available.
