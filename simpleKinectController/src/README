This is an very simple GUI on which the user will be able to set the Kinect height and look through its camera.
Multi-Kinect will be supported
OpenGL will be used to render the images.

Created with Qt 5.0.1 and Microsoft Kinect SDK

Ideas(from the dev, to the dev): Make a KinectManager, which contains two maps. The first map conatins a key and a pointer to an INUISensor, the second map contains the same key and a QString. 
The QString indicates possible errors, so the end-user can see them.

Also: all comminucation will go trough this manager. The main will connect the signals and slots from the mainWindow to the s&s of the KinectManager, and the KinectManager will connect those signals and slots to the KinectObject
if one is chosen. The Window will get only the first map, so the window does not even know what a Kinect is. Because of the keys the manager knows what Kinect the GUI is talking about and if possible it will activate this Kinect.
