# LiveScan3D #
LiveScan3D is a system designed for real time 3D reconstruction using multiple Kinect v2 depth sensors simultaneously at real time speed.

The produced 3D reconstruction is in the form of a coloured point cloud, with points from all of the Kinects placed in the same coordinate system. Possible use scenarios of the system include:
  * capturing an object’s 3D structure from multiple viewpoints simultaneously,
  * capturing a “panoramic” 3D structure of a scene (extending the field of view of one sensor by using many),
  * streaming the reconstructed point cloud to a remote location, 
  * increasing the density of a point cloud captured by a single sensor, by having multiple sensors capture the same scene.

You will also find a short presentation of LiveScan3D in the video below (click to go to YouTube):

At the moment connecting multiple Kinect v2 devices to a single computer is difficult and only possible under Linux. Also, the number of the devices or capture speed might be low, because of the limitations of the PCI-E bus.

Because of those limitations, in our system each Kinect v2 sensor is connected to a separate computer. Each of those computers is connected to a server which governs all of the sensors. The server allows the user to perform calibration, filtering, synchronized frame capture, and to visualize the acquired point cloud live.

## How to use it ##
To start working with our software you will need a Windows machine with the Kinect for Windows SDK 2.0, and at least a single Kinect v2 device. You can either build LiveScan3D from source which is easiest using Visual Studio, or you can download the binary release.

Both the binary and source distributions contain a manual (in the docs directory) which contains the steps necessary to start working with our software (it won't take more than a couple of minutes to set up).
